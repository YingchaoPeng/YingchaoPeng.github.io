🏃 I'm a Ph.D. student in [Professor Paul Plucinsky's group](https://sites.usc.edu/plucinsky/) at the University of Southern California. 

🚀 My research focuses on mechanical metamaterials, solid mechanics, kirigami/origami design, and topology optimization. I think about how to cut, fold, and optimize materials to make them behave in ways Mother Nature never intended ❤️. 

🤯 We aim to build rigorous theoretical frameworks to understand and predict the fascinating behaviors that emerge in mechanical metamaterials, from floppy modes and bistability to programmable shape transformations, to name a few. I'm always excited by how geometry can encode function and motion.

⚽️ By day, I battle equations to uncover hidden mechanics embedded in metamaterials; by night, I fight the urge to turn every piece of paper into a kirigami prototype—or analyze Real Madrid’s latest formation-or play badminton 🏸
